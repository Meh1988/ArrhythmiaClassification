Ensemble vs. Single Deep Learning Model Comparison with Feature Selection.


This document provides a Python code example to compare the training history of an ensemble of deep learning models with a single deep learning model, both utilizing feature selection. The code demonstrates how to:

Load and preprocess the dataset.
Train a single deep learning model with feature selection.
Train an ensemble of deep learning models with feature selection.
Visualize the training history of both the ensemble and the single model.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

NumPy
pandas
TensorFlow
scikit-learn
matplotlib
Dataset
The code assumes the use of the "arrhythmia.data" dataset, which contains attributes related to cardiac arrhythmia classification. The dataset is preprocessed by replacing missing values with column means and standardizing the features. 
This database contains 279 attributes, 206 of which are linear valued and the rest are nominal. Concerning the study of H. Altay Guvenir: "The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it in one of the 16 groups. Class 01 refers to 'normal' ECG classes 02 to 15 refers to different classes of arrhythmia and class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones. For the time being, there exists a computer program that makes such a classification. However there are differences between the cardiolog's and the programs classification. Taking the cardiolog's as a gold standard we aim to minimise this difference by means of machine learning tools." The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.

Code Overview
Load and preprocess the dataset:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Replace missing values (denoted as '?') with NaN.
Convert data to numeric values and handle missing values by imputing with column means.
Scale the data using StandardScaler.
Encode class labels using LabelEncoder.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Create a base deep learning model:

Define a function create_model to create a simple feedforward neural network model.
Train the single deep learning model with feature selection:

Apply feature selection using SelectKBest and f_classif.
Train the single deep learning model with the selected features and record its training history.
Train an ensemble of deep learning models with feature selection:

Create an ensemble of deep learning models using BaggingClassifier.
Train each individual model within the ensemble and record their training histories.
Visualize the training history:

Plot the training history of the ensemble models and the single model on the same plot.
Compare the training accuracy curves over the epochs.
Usage
Ensure that the required libraries are installed.
Prepare the "arrhythmia.data" dataset and place it in the same directory as the script.
Run the provided code in a Python environment.
Observe the plotted comparison of the training history for the ensemble of models and the single model.


Conclusion
This code provides an example of comparing the training history of an ensemble of deep learning models with a single deep learning model, both utilizing feature selection. By visualizing the training accuracy curves, you can gain insights into how the ensemble and the single model perform during training. This comparison can help you make informed decisions when selecting a modeling approach for your classification task.
